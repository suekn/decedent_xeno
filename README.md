## Physiology and Immunology of Pig-to-Human Decedent Kidney Xenotransplant 
**Single Cell RNA and TCR Sequencing Analysis**

## Description
This repository contains the analysis code and associated scripts for the paper titled "Physiology and Immunology of Pig-to-Human Decedent Kidney Xenotransplant ". The work focuses on using single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing combined with xenoreactivity data to study immune cell dynamics in xenotransplantation.
